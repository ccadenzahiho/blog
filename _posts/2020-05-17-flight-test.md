### Right Then. 

Lets try to remember all the relevant formatting I'll probably use. 

# This is Heading 1. 

## This is Heading 2. 

### This is Heading 3. 

...and I believe we have up to 6 headings. 

<div class="divider"></div>

What I just did above and below should be a dividing line. 

<div class="divider"></div>

## Listing Items

1. this is the first object
2. this is the second

I can also do unordered lists.
* bananas
* eggs

nice. 

<div class="divider"></div>

There's more stuff besides this like tables, math, and footnotes but I don't think I'll use them. 

Let's check out the media.

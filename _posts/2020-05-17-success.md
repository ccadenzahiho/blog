Alright so I literally just spent at least like 8 hours over the past 2 days grinding out this github blog and I think it's basically ready. I had no idea what I was doing half the time and I basically just ripped a template and listen to an old guy on youtube rant about base urls which gave me **living hell**. 

It's still quite primitive. I think in this post I'm gonna see if I can directly paste in an image from my local files. If it works you'll see some anime girl idk 

<div class="divider"></div>

Ok so I just tried to do it and it already didn't let me put it into the .md which _I guess_ makes sense because its sorta like a text file. Hmm... well what can you do, I guess I'll try giving the image a temp link... here we go...

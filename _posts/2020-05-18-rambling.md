I don't even know what I want to do with this blog now that I've set it up and all. Maybe in uni I'll end up using it to track my experiences like a journal sort of thing but at the same time I think there are better ways to do that like using a physical journal. 

However, it feels nice uploading shit to the internet so maybe I'll actually use this... 

Anyways the topic today is rambling so may as well get to that (as if i haven't been doing that)

Samurai Champloo? Kinda sick, ngl. It's got the same sorta disconnected vibes as Bebop but that makes sense since it's made by the same dude. Shinichiro Watanabe or something. I've seen up to ep 3 and it's pulled me in. The screenplay/storyboarding is something else. 

_also its a nice change since I've been watching romcoms and shoujos for like 3 years_ 

anyways. thats all here's a pic

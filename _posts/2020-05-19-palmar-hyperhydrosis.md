It's no big deal. I'm walking down the hallway on the way to a volunteering orientation. I'm not nervous and I'm pretty prepared to meet some new people and just get things over with so I can get certified or whatever. Walk up to the front desk. Still not nervous. Suddenly the pores of my hands suddenly decide to bud open like the stomata of a leaf and beads of sweat start to cover my hands. 

_fuck, fuck fuck I'm not even nervous why is this happening_ 

I wipe my hands on my pants quickly and stroll up to the front desk. Kind faces greet me and guide me to sign some arbitrary paperwork. My hands are uncontrollably sweating at this point. The pen in my hand starts glistening with moisture. The paperwork starts curling from the condensation being produced around my fingers. Several people notice but don't say anything. The paper curls into tube as I hand it back to the staff. I smily grimly and walk into the main lobby. 

This time, I wring my hands in my shirt to get rid of more sweat, but it's to no avail. My palms are a creature of their own, respiring and uncontrollably releasing copious amounts of liquid from within. I am disgusted. I haven't even gotten to the hand shaking yet. 

A staff intrudes on my lamentation when he suddenly extends his hand and introduces himself. 

_well, here we go..._ 

Palm to palm. Wrap the fingers around. One shake is optimal, two shakes is sorta weird but acceptable. No more than that. Some people like to their left hand over those of the conjoined parties but honestly that's kinda cringe. The grip? Must be firm and confident. It shouldn't feel like you're holding a fish or you're being crushed. 

I am a master of handshakes in theory, though in practice, my genetic disposition causes everything to crash and burn. 

Palm to palm. Wait fuck my hands are too slippery. Wrap the fingers around... ok we did that but barely. I can mentally picture the drops of sweat transferring to the poor guy's skin cells. I ignore it and do one shake, nice and firm, but my hand only barely manages to stay in the grip due to the sweat's lubricative properties... 

And that's a handshake. 

I manage to force out a smile at the guy, and he does too. We make some nonsense chitchat and ignore the sweat dripping off of our hands, and it's quite a good conversation, actually. I'm starting to think that maybe my hands weren't that sweaty, after all. The orientation finally starts, and he runs off to help set up the presentation. 

_well, that didn't seem so bad after all._

But just as he turns the corner, I can see the staff vigorously wiping his hands on his pants, desperately trying to purify his sweat-tainted hands. 

Alas, this is the story of a man who fights against fate, the world, and his Palmar Hyperhydrosis.

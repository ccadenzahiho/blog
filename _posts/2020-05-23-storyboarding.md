When you consume anything, be it through text, image, video, whatever, you are seeing it through the perspective of the creator. It will always be a biased view, and it's less of a "how much of this is subjective?" situation, but more of a "how much objectivity is being lost?" kinda thing.  

I could go on to talk about news sources, fake news, blah blah blah, but I'm gonna talk about storyboarding instead.

Pic above is a scene from "Knocking on Heaven's Door" from Bebop. I've been watching a bunch of Shinichir≈ç Watanabe movies mainly because of how strong the storyboarding is, even though his content may not necessarily enjoyable because of how episodic they are. He breaks away from Chekov's Gun and includes content that leads to nowhere, but its... for the lack of a better word, a vibe. All of his stuff has a vibe to it that is internalized within you. It's pretty sick. 

The perspectives he gives you for the stories he wants to tell goes under careful consideration, and there's meaning in what is shown and what is left to conjecture. So looking back on this "subjective vs. objective" situation, I think that Watanabe does a pretty good job of utilizing this spectrum to his advantage and sort of "manipulating" our conceptions.

Another one from Champloo. Wish I could find some better examples but this is the best I can do from google images. 

Anyways. Watanabe's storyboarding is sick, even if the stories themselves aren't particularly plot centric. It's the vibes...

title: The Substance of Style 
---

I picked up this book at the library sale sometime in Jan. It was literally 50 cents but I think the value goes quite beyond that. 

I've only read about half of it so far, but here's what I've gotten out of it: 

* Since the rise of globalization and communication, the sensory and aesthetic components of life have been rising in importance.
* Ex. products are not only being made for function, but for form. Computers are slimming down, standard appliances are being made sleek and shiny, and even seemingly arbitrary products such as a toilet plunger are being made to appear finer than their use. 
* Superficial, "useless" aspects of products are now considered to be desirable. 
* It is more of a "I like how this feels" rather than a "I like how this works". 
* All of this leads to rise of individuality/expression. 
* Monotonous uniforms, identical haircuts of the 20th century are long gone. 

Essentially the author just shoved alot of "Hey, aesthetics are now relevant in the 21st century!" down our throats. They have not, however, discusses the disadvantages of such a thing. They're mostly just praising how important it is to adapt to this trend, and not what may lie in the future... but maybe they'll talk about that in the second half.

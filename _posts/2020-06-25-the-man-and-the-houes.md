Title: The man and the house
---

Once upon a time there was a man. His name is of no significance. The man lived in a house with features that were equally as insignificant. The man was strong. He was intelligent. But he never allowed others to enter the house, and rarely left it himself. Over the years, he would inspect his house from within, never quite aware of the damage on the exterior. It was only when the ceiling began leaking, or when the floorboards began shifting beneath his soles that he would get to work, patching the deformities. It wasn't very often that the man would notice any defects, but when he did, it was his first priority to repair it. He never knew the burdens his house carried outside, but the man was dedicated and diligent in keeping the interior in pristine shape. 

Every day of his life the man wished that someone would break into his home. Those who politely asked, or knocked on the door were turned away by the manâ€”but they would still chat in the doorway, or on the porch. The man was brave, and he was kind. He wasn't afraid of leaving his house, venturing out into the world, but something in his subconscious always tugged him into his home when the day concluded. The man was self aware as well. He knew he neglected the exterior, yet he focused his attention on the amenities of the interior. 

It is said that he still waits to this day for somebody to break into his home.

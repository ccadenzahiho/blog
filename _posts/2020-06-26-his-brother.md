title: His Brother
---

His eyes, normally bright and brown, turned into a dark abyss, swallowing the light from the chandelier above. His pupils seemed to merge into his iris. It seemed as if it was an all consuming eclipse, yet it wasn't of anger, regret, or sorrow. It was a contemplative look. It was one of reflection... but ironically, his eyes exhibited no such characteristic. 

"My brother was perfectly normal until I was 11," he started. "He was only a year below me. Now, I'm 54, and he's 53. He hasn't worked a day in his life. He still lives in the shack where I was born, and the roof caved in the other day. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I've already purchased another property for him to live in, in Guanzhou. Yet he refuses."

The narrator had been to the shack. It was a humble place, but it was beaten down, dirty, and unsuitable for somebody to actually live in. The walls used to be made of wood, but were now patched up with whatever materials were on hand, making it seem like the walls were slowly closing in. Unidentifiable items were strewn about the floor, walls, and even hung up on the rafters of the ceiling. It was inconceviable that somebody lived there for 20 years as the man had, but his brother had lived there for over twice that period. 

His eyes flashed for a second. "I bought that property 20 years ago. I had moved to Canada, and saved up money working a job at a restaurant for years. After saving enough money, I emptied almost all of my bank account to buy a nicer place for my brother and my mother, who lived with him. But it was never used," the man grimaced. "My mom only lived for a few weeks in that apartment, but always returned to my brother to take care of him in the shack. No amount of begging would convince my brother to move out." 

Like a mother goose lifts up each of her ducklings over a ledge, the man's mother kept trying to lift her remaining son, yet no amount of lifting found a result. It was a sad and despicable way to live. 

"My mother died living in that shack. Can you believe it? Tending to her duckling, the goose dies. My extended family had always told my mother that she should just move out to my place in Guanzhou and leave my brother to rot and starve, or at least force him to come to his senses. But my mom cared about my brother. It's just a law of mother nature. The goose tends to her duckling. She couldn't just leave him alone. But at the end of it all, it didn't matter. The outcome was the same. My mother died, and my brother is alone now. Had my mother left or stayed, it would've been the same either way." 

The duckling didn't want to get over the ledge. It wanted to stay. The duckling had the ability and the opportunity, yet refused to take it. So, as mother goose's ducklings waddled off into their futures, she stayed behind, tending to the one leftover. Losing the future. 

The man shifted in his chair. It was an uncomfortable topic, but he was a man that had become used to uncomfortable things. He was taking care of his brother, after all. His eyes remained emotionless still. "What could I have possibly done? Right before I left, I found so many jobs for him that I had lost count. I had good connections with people working the culinary service. They said that wherever my brother wanted to work in the district, they would make sure he learned, worked, and was safe. He refused." 

The narrator interjected. "Did you ever ask why?"

"I did. He said 'I have a brother who works as a truck driver. I won't do a job that isn't as good as my brother's.' That was the first and last time he gave me a reason why he wouldn't work." 

It had been 30 long years since he had left his brother, and the visits every five or so years were unyielding for both men. The narrator could feel, subconsciously, that the man despised his brother. That he blamed his mother's death on him. That he blamed his brother for being so insufferable, so immovable. That he had done his side of the bargain, and the rest was god's fury; a supernatural, unspeakable force that willed his brother to be so indifferentâ€”so infuriating. Or was this something the narrator felt, and was projecting onto the man? The events of the man's story happened long before the narrator was born. Would something have been different if the narrator was around then, when they could've offered advice? The narrator harboured the same sentiments they believed the man did. Or did the man even feel this way at all? The line between brotherly love and hatred blurred, mixing into a murky cloud that settled on the table.   

A silence fell between the narrator and the man as they waited for the cloud to dissipate. 

"It's too late to change now. Whatever I say now can't change the past, and you can't do anything to change the future. I may as well be saying this for naught, but I think it's still worth saying." said the narrator. "No quality of property or money would have convinced your brother. It's you and your identity that mattered to him. You should've gone back and lived with him. Live through his eyes. Spend your days with him. Slowly open him up to more opportunities, or taken him on an outing in your truck. It's clear there was an emotional blockage. You may have been the only one to take that away. When you bought the property, you opened a door, and left. What you should've done instead is open that door, and guide him through it. Maybe that would've changed how things are today, or maybe they wouldn't have. It's just another path for another outcome, now lost to time." 

The man thought for a moment, as if another cloud had condensed onto the table. His face was emotionless, and unreadable as always. He put his hands on his knees to push himself up, poured himself a cup of tea, and exited the room. 

"Well, there's no point talking about it then."

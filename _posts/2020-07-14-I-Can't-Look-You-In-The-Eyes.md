Title: I Can't Look You In The Eyes
---

I don't think it would be as bad if I was blind because then I wouldn't see them staring inside me and I think it might be easier that way is what I think. There are some people that can see inside me and some people that can't but the way I see it all of them are the same all of the eyes are penetrating feeling lingering. Sometimes if I force myself I can stare into your eyes but then I feel like I am taking something from you and you are taking something from me and something feels wrong so I look away and busy myself with arbitrary business yet still conversations lead the same way and sure I pay attention I'm a good listener I'm a swell conversationalist though maybe it would be better if I looked into you and you looked into me. If our eyes lock my senses explode and it feels like I'm disappearing so I have to look away so I can stay here and keep talking so don't mind me I'm just trying to stay here and it's not just you don't feel special I am using the generic 'you' but there is someone. There is one I can stare into and feel nothing and I think this is rather intriguing because such a case is special but I don't feel special and I think this unspecialness makes it quite special. I can see into them and they can see into me but nothing else happens and nothing else is felt and sometimes they look away first and sometimes I look away first and it feels like nothing was taken and nothing was stolen so sometimes I think that they're like me and wish they were blind and would share something instead of taking it because I can't look you in the eyes.

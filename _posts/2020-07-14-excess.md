"Why would somebody ever say something like this?" 

"Is something wrong with it?" 

"It's like begging for attention. Begging for validation. I've been there myself. You want somebody to say, 'You're not excess! You belong! You are an indispensible part of our group!'. It's like you're looking through the door at a party and decide to sit on the stairs outside instead. Even worse, you might look in now and then and see everyone having enjoying themselves. You pray somebody steps out, peeks your way, sitting outside in the dark, but nobody does. Is that your fault? Sort of. Maybe if you sat alone inside instead of on the stairs things would be different. You willingly distance yourself from others, but have a desire for a warm body to be beside you. Or rather, you have a hunger for one. It's a pitiful train of thought, and a wasteful plane of existence." 

"Is it that difficult to spare some time or a few words for somebody like that? If they have such a hunger for contact, why not give it to them? It means so little to you, but so much to them." 

"Does it?" 

"Can't say. Either way, what do you lose?"

"Nothing. It's just hard to do."

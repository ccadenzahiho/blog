title: The Seagull and the Turtle
---
Once upon a time there was a seagull and a turtle. The seagull stood at the edge of the dock, while the turtle swam idly beneath. They had a conversation. 

The seagull asked, "Do you know Toyota?" 

The turtle replied, "Of course, I know it well." 

The seagull paused and said, "What if I showed you? would you come look?"

The turtle said yes without a thought. What a foolish bird! Who in this world doesn't know of such a dominant automobile company? 

The seagull went to find Toyota, and returned to the dock.

The turtle was waiting on the edge, but could not see Toyota yet.

The seagull said, "Turtle! Come see Toyota!" 

The turtle laughed and began swimming to the beach. It eventually crawled its way onto the docks, and was deftly caught by a hunter named Toyota.

The seagull says, "There are 4 characters and 2 fools in this story. The turtle is a fool. Toyota and I are not fools. That leaves one other." 

The seagull turns to you. Then a Toyota Corolla falls out of the sky and plunges into the ocean, without making a splash.

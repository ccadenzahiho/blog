Hi there. 

I'm an incoming Medical Sciences/Ivey student at Western University. 

I play the violin and enjoy running, volleyball, and ultimate. I like to learn new things and dabble in stuff I find interesting, like this Github blog. I enjoy meeting new people as well, so check out my socials below. Enjoy.
